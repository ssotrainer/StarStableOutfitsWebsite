The hat, shirt, and boots are from the Disco Daze shop in &nbsp;Fort Pinta, and the pants are from Jollister in Govenor's Falls. As for tack, any black bridle with a white saddlepad and white leg wraps work. I like to use the black sporty saddle from the quick shop for this outfit as it has white fuzz on it, but any black saddle will do the job. I got the saddlebag from the saddlebag shop in Aideen's Plaza and the teddy bear was from a special Valentines Day shop by Moorland Stables. The mane and tail decorations are from the horse accessories shop at the mall.</div>

The saddlepad and bridle are available at the horse equipment shop at the mall and the leg wraps are found at the horse accessories shop at the mall. I got the saddle from the quick shop and the mane and tail bows are from a code that may or may not be expired, "OPENHOUSERED". For extra pizzaz, add the "Cute Baker's Saddlebag" from Jamie's shop in New Hillcrest and in it, put the cute donkey that you get from Mary's donkey-finding quest by Jorvik Stables.</div>
